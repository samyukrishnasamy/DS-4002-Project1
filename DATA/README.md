# Exploratory Plots

We generated four exploratory plots to better understand the SMS Spam Collection dataset. These plots highlight class imbalance, data quality, and message characteristics.

### 1. Class Distribution (Ham vs Spam)
Shows the frequency of ham vs spam messages. The imbalance emphasizes the need for oversampling.

### 2. Duplicates by Category
Displays how many duplicate messages exist within each class, confirming whether repeated messages could bias the model.

### 3. Message Length Distribution
Compares message length between ham and spam. Spam messages are typically longer, suggesting length could be a useful feature.

### 4. Missing Values
Checks for null or missing entries in both `Label` and `Message`. The dataset is clean with no missing values.
